## Setup

Mac OS X computers already have Python 2, so do not install Python 3 (or any Python).

To start python, type on your terminal:

```
$ python
```

To exit, type:

```
$ quit()
```

## A Good First Program

Type the following text into a single file named `ex1.py`. Python works best with files ending in `.py`.

```python
print "Hello World!"
print "Hello Again"
print "I like typing this."
print "This is fun."
print 'Yay! Printing.'
print "I'd much rather you 'not'."
print 'I "said" do not touch this.'
```

In terminal run:

```
$ python src/ex1.py
```
